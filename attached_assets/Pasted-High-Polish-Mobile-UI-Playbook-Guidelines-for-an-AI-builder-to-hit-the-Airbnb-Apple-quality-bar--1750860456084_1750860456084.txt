High-Polish Mobile UI Playbook
Guidelines for an AI builder to hit the “Airbnb / Apple” quality bar on the RoomieFlow app.

1. Anchor everything in a few core principles
Unified – every screen and component feels like part of one system (no odd one-offs).

Universal – welcoming visuals and copy that work for a global, diverse audience.

Iconic – bold, instantly recognisable shapes; nothing fussy.

Conversational – motion and copy that talk to the user in a friendly, human tone.

2. Layout & spacing
Base grid: multiples of 8 pt; half-steps (4 pt) only for fine tweaks.

Edge margin = 16 pt on phones; keep text columns ≤ 600 pt wide to avoid fatigue. 
developer.apple.com

Group related elements with consistent vertical rhythm—e.g., 24 pt between card stacks, 12 pt between a label and its value.

3. Typography
Use SF Pro (Apple system font) in a type scale: Large Title 34 / Bold → Title 1 28 / Semibold → Body 17 / Regular → Footnote 13 / Regular.

Never track body text; instead rely on correct line-height (≥ 120 % of font size).

Reserve weight shifts (Regular → Semibold) to signal “tap targets” or totals.

4. Colour & contrast
Pick one brand accent (e.g., teal #00C2B3). Use it for:

Primary buttons

Active tab & selected states

Progress rings

Desaturate all other UI chrome (greys 90 %, 70 %, 40 %).

Maintain WCAG AA contrast for text: ≥ 4.5:1 for body, 3:1 for large text.

5. Iconography & imagery
All icons from SF Symbols, “Regular” weight, outlined style for idle states, filled on action.

Keep stroke width uniform (≈ 1.5 pt) to match text weight.

Use square, softly shadowed “cards” for photos/avatars—8 pt corner radius, 8 pt inner padding.

6. Motion & micro-interactions
Duration guidelines: micro-states 120 ms, element transitions 300 ms, page transitions ≤ 450 ms.

Use ease-in-out-curve on entrances; ease-out on exits so the interface “rests”.

Add UIImpactFeedbackStyle.light haptic on:

Marking a chore done

Sending a chat message

Completing a payment split

Animate progress rings and balance counters with counting-up tween (30 fps cap for battery).

7. Component kit (reusable, token-driven)
Purpose	Component	Key rules
Overview	Dashboard Card	16 pt padding, 8 pt internal grid, icon 24 × 24 pt, title Body Semibold, subtitle Footnote Regular.
Comms	Chat Bubble	12 pt radius; sender accent background at 15 % opacity; 4 pt tail offset.
Planning	Calendar Tile	44 × 44 pt tappable; selected = filled accent circle with white numeral.
Money	Expense Row	Leading avatar 40 pt, two-line title/amount stack, trailing “Settle” pill button.
Tasks	Chore Chip	Capsule, accent border 1 pt; tick animation fills background on completion.

All components read their size, typography, spacing, radius, elevation, and colour from a single token file so dark-mode/theming is automatic.

8. Accessibility essentials
All touch targets ≥ 44 × 44 pt.

Respect iOS Dynamic Type—scale fonts & line-heights via UIFontMetrics.

Provide VoiceOver labels (“Trash night – due today, assigned to Alex”) and accessibility actions for swipe gestures.

Offer a high-contrast toggle: swap greys to #000/#FFF and bump border thickness to 2 pt.

9. Dark mode / theming
Use paired colour tokens (surfaceLight / surfaceDark, textPrimaryLight / textPrimaryDark).

Keep accent colour identical in both modes for brand recognition (unless fails contrast).

Elevation: shadows in light mode, subtle inner strokes or overlays in dark mode.

10. Performance & polish checklist
App launch < 400 ms on an iPhone 15.

Scroll at 120 fps (remove expensive shadows in long lists).

Defer network calls until after first frame.

Prefetch images and cache chat history locally for offline reads.

Ship with lightweight empty states: illustration + sentence + primary button.

Summary for the AI builder
Use a 16 pt edge margin, 8 pt grid, SF Pro type scale, accent-driven colour scheme, SF Symbols icon set, subtle haptics, and tokenised components. Prioritise clarity, warmth, and effortless flow—everything else (code structure, database) is up to you.
