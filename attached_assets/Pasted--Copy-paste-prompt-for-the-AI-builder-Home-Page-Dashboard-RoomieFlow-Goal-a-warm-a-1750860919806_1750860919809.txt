> **Home Page (Dashboard) – RoomieFlow**
> Goal: a warm, airy “hub” that instantly shows each roommate what matters *today*.
> Follow Airbnb/Apple visual language: lots of white space, big rounded cards, gentle motion, SF Pro type scale, accent-colour highlights.
>
> **Layout**
> • Safe-area top padding + 16 pt edge margins.
> • Large Title (“Good morning, Alex”) left-aligned, 34 pt, Bold.
> • Below title, vertical stack of **4 dynamic cards** (max height 180 pt each, 12 pt gap):
>
> 1. **Chore Card** – shows next chore’s icon, name, assignee avatar, “Mark done” pill button.
> 2. **Bills Card** – total balance line (“You owe \$23”), list of up to 2 outstanding items, “Settle up” button.
> 3. **Calendar Card** – today’s event chip (time + title) and mini month toggle.
> 4. **Chat Card** – last message preview + unread badge.
>    • If any section has nothing due today, replace its card with an “empty-state” version: friendly illustration + quick-add button.
>
> **Visual rules**
> • Card container: 12 pt radius, soft shadow (y = 2, blur = 8, 10 % black).
> • Internal grid: 16 pt padding, 8 pt row spacing.
> • Accent colour (#00C2B3 default) for primary buttons, unread badge, progress rings.
> • Icons from SF Symbols, Outline style 24 × 24 pt; filled on interaction.
> • Typography scale: Title 3 20 / Semibold for card headings; Body 17 / Regular for details; Footnote 13 for timestamps.
>
> **Interactions**
> • Tap a card → slides in corresponding detail tab (300 ms ease-in-out).
> • Swipe right on a card → quick action (e.g., complete chore, mark bill paid) with light haptic.
> • Pull-to-refresh triggers a subtle spinner above title (accent colour stroke).
>
> **State handling**
> • Animate card reorder when priorities change (spring 0.5 damping).
> • Offline: show grey “syncing…” banner pinned below title; queue actions locally.
> • Dark mode: swap surfaces to #1C1C1E, use inner stroke instead of shadow.
>
> **Accessibility**
> • All interactive zones ≥ 44 × 44 pt.
> • Dynamic Type scales up to Accessibility XL without truncation.
> • VoiceOver labels: “Trash night chore, due today, assigned to you, double-tap to mark done.”
>
> **Deliverable**
> A single SwiftUI view (or equivalent) implementing the above layout, tokens, and interactions—ready to slot into the app’s tab bar as “Home.”
