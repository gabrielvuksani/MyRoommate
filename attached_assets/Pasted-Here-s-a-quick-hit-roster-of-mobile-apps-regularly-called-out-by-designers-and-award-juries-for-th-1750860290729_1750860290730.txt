Here’s a quick-hit roster of mobile apps regularly called out by designers (and award juries) for the same “everything feels just right” polish that Airbnb is known for:

### Everyday living & utilities

* **Splitwise** – sets the gold standard for making money-splitting painless: ultra-clean totals screen, friendly colour palette, and zero-friction editing.
* **Headspace** – calm motion, soft gradients, and playful illustrations turn routine meditation into a tiny delight every time you open it. ([winners.webbyawards.com][1])
* **Monzo** (banking) – card-based feed, bold typography, and instant feedback on every transaction keep complex finances feeling human.

### Communication & collaboration

* **Slack** – consistently sharp iconography and thoughtful micro-interactions (reactions, threads) that scale from two users to thousands.
* **Notion** – minimal but powerful; blocks and drag-handles guide users without clutter, while light/dark theming feels native on iOS.

### Tasks & organisation

* **Things 3** – award-winning structure: large touch targets, subtle shadows, natural language date parsing; everything animates just enough.
* **Trello** – card-based kanban board with smooth drag-and-drop and colour labels that make task states obvious at a glance.

### Travel & mobility

* **Uber** – high-contrast map layer, dynamic fare estimate pill, and one-hand reachable controls; proves that information density can stay elegant.
* **Hopper** – playful predictions and pastel charts wrap sophisticated price models in a welcoming look.

### Wellness & fitness

* **Strava** – clear data visualisation, personalised heat maps, and satisfying trophy animations reward healthy habits.
* **Oura** – ring-friendly sleep scores presented with airy spacing and gentle gradients.

### Creative & play

* **Procreate Dreams** – Apple Design Award winner; fluid gesture-driven timeline editing and subtle haptics make pro animation touch-first. ([developer.apple.com][2])
* **NYT Games** – recent Design Award winner for inclusivity; crisp typography, dark-mode perfection, and tactile puzzle interactions. ([developer.apple.com][2])

### Why they’re great (traits to study)

1. **Hierarchy & whitespace** – generous padding keeps even data-heavy screens calm.
2. **Consistent iconography** – custom icon sets in a single stroke weight feel cohesive.
3. **Micro-interactions** – tiny haptics or easing curves signal success without words.
4. **Dark-mode parity** – every colour token designed in pairs, not afterthoughts.
5. **Accessibility** – larger tap targets, VoiceOver labels, and Dynamic Type support baked in from day one.

Use these patterns as inspiration when polishing your roommate app’s dashboard cards, chat bubbles, chore check-offs, and bill-split flows.
