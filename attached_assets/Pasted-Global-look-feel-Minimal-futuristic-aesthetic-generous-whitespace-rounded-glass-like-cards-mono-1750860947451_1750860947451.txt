Global look & feel
Minimal-futuristic aesthetic: generous whitespace, rounded glass-like cards, monochrome base with a single bold accent. Fluid motion, soft shadows, tactile haptics. All data lives in one real-time cloud database so every change is visible to all roommates instantly—even offline edits queue and merge later.
