### Core design cues (the agent chooses specifics)

| Pillar        | Direction                                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Colour**    | Quiet neutrals everywhere; one refined accent for actions & status.      |
| **Type**      | Clean modern sans; hierarchy via size & weight, not loud colours.        |
| **Shapes**    | Soft but mature corner radius; consistent across cards, chips, buttons.  |
| **Depth**     | Feather-light shadows to hint interactivity; no dotted or heavy borders. |
| **Motion**    | Quick, understated transitions; tiny haptic ticks on success.            |
| **Copy tone** | Friendly, concise, first-person (“Your next chore is…”).                 |

### Screen priorities

| Screen        | Show first                                                                | Then                                  | Main action              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Home**      | What needs attention today (next chore • unpaid balance • upcoming event) | Friendly greeting • last chat snippet | Tap a card to dive in    |
| **Chores**    | Today’s tasks carousel                                                    | History streaks                       | “Mark done”              |
| **Bills**     | Net balance headline                                                      | Itemised list                         | “Add expense” / “Settle” |
| **Calendar**  | Compact month                                                             | Agenda list                           | “Add event”              |
| **Chat**      | Household thread                                                          | Reactions, inline images              | Compose                  |
| **Groceries** | Live checklist                                                            | Purchased archive                     | “Add item”               |
| **Polls**     | Active polls grid                                                         | Past polls                            | Vote                     |

*For every empty state:* classy line illustration + single accent button (e.g., “Add chore”) — no grey boxes.

---

### Accessibility must-haves

* Thumb-sized tap targets
* Full Dynamic Type scaling
* VoiceOver speaks role + status (“Rent due tomorrow, you owe \$550, double-tap to view”)

---

### Self-check mantra

> **“Everything visible has a clear job, nothing more.”**

Hand these guard-rails to the design agent; let it own the detailed palette, icon set, spacing system, and final layouts — as long as the result feels premium, sophisticated, and instantly understandable.
