# RoomieHub

**Mission**
Give every shared household one calm, central place to talk, plan, clean, and split costs. Open the app → know exactly what needs your attention.

### 1. Core use cases (MUST nail these)

* **Chat that keeps context**

  * Real-time group chat with reactions, GIFs, voice notes.
  * Any message can be linked to a bill, chore, calendar event, or grocery item so details never get buried.

* **Chores that run themselves**

  * Kanban board: To-Do → Doing → Done.
  * Auto-rotating assignments, recurrence rules (daily, weekly, monthly, custom).
  * Push reminder + optional “snooze 24 h” button.
  * Streak tracker and fun confetti when someone hits 7 chores in a row.

* **Bills & balances without headaches**

  * Add an expense in two taps (scan receipt or type).
  * Split equally, by shares, or custom percentages.
  * Running balance screen shows who owes whom; one-tap “Settle Up” opens preferred payment method (Venmo, PayPal, Interac, Revolut, etc.).
  * Export monthly CSV or PDF of all expenses for transparency.

* **Shared calendar everyone actually checks**

  * Colour-coded events: rent due, utility cutoff, birthdays, house dinner.
  * Chore deadlines and bill due dates are auto-added.
  * Push alerts: three-day reminder + day-of.

* **Smart grocery & supplies list**

  * Real-time collaborative list with item counts (e.g., “Eggs – 0 left”).
  * Swipe right to mark bought; app asks whether to attach the cost to a new bill.
  * Low-stock warnings based on purchase frequency (“We’re out of toilet paper every 10 days – want a recurring bulk order?”).

### 2. Nice-to-have boosters (if time allows)

* **Roomie Profiles** – avatar, pronouns, allergy/diet notes, quiet hours, payment handles.
* **House Rules & Agreement** – a simple checklist everyone e-signs at onboarding; editable later.
* **Conflict Log** – private note space to record disputes; optional mediation tips.
* **Guest Mode** – register visiting friends so housemates know who’s around and split added costs if needed.
* **Energy Tracker** – enter monthly utility totals → app graphs usage vs. last month and suggests savings.
* **Gamified Leaderboard** – points for chores done, bills logged on time, helpful chat replies; optional prize pool.

---

### 3. Essential user flows (step-by-step)

1. **Onboarding**

   * Choose “Create house” or “Join with code / QR”.
   * Set rent amount + due date, default currency, payment links.
   * Pick initial chore template (bathroom, kitchen, trash).
   * Invite others via link or QR.

2. **Add a bill**

   * Tap “+ Bill” → snap receipt → OCR pulls total and vendor.
   * Select payer → choose split method → save.
   * Balances update; optional reminder sent to owing roommates.

3. **Mark chore done**

   * Drag card to “Done” or tap checkbox.
   * Streak updated; if chore recurring, next due date auto-generated and, if rotation enabled, assigned to next roommate.

4. **Plan event**

   * Tap date in calendar → enter title, time, choose icon (party, maintenance, landlord visit).
   * Toggle “notify all”.
   * Event appears on dashboard and sends reminders.

---

### 4. Interaction principles

* All high-value actions ≤ 3 taps away.
* Swipe gestures for the repetitive stuff (settle, delete, mark done).
* Push notifications respect each roommate’s quiet-hour setting.
* Friendly micro-copy with emojis where helpful (“🎉 Bathroom sparkles! Thanks, Alex.”).
* Accessibility baked in: VoiceOver labels, large-text support, colour-blind-safe palette.

---

### 5. External hooks (keep technical detail minimal)

* Real-time sync, auth, and push – any mainstream backend-as-a-service (Firebase, Supabase, Appwrite).
* Payments – deep-link to external apps; no money handled in-app.
* Receipt OCR – free tier of any widely available vision API.
* Optional calendar sync – export iCal feed per house.

---

### 6. Stretch delights

* Voice command: “Hey RoomieHub, add milk.”
* Home-screen widget: today’s chores + who owes you.
* AR view: overlay chores (e.g., highlight spots to clean) using device camera.
* Move-out mode: archive balances, export data, reset house code for new tenants.

---

### 7. Definition of “done”

* A new user can create a house, invite roommates, add a chore, add a bill, and see it reflected in everyone’s app in under five minutes — no tutorial needed.
