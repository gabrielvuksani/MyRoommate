# MyRoommate iOS App Deployment Guide

## ðŸ“± iOS App Setup Complete

Your MyRoommate web app has been successfully converted to a native iOS app using Capacitor. Here's everything you need to know about deploying it to the App Store.

## What's Been Created

âœ… **Capacitor Configuration**: Complete iOS project setup
âœ… **Native iOS Project**: Located in `ios/App/` directory
âœ… **Capacitor Plugins**: Status bar, splash screen, haptics, keyboard, and app lifecycle
âœ… **Build Scripts**: Automated web asset generation and sync

## Project Structure

```
MyRoommate/
â”œâ”€â”€ ios/App/                    # Native iOS Xcode project
â”œâ”€â”€ capacitor.config.ts         # Capacitor configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ build-ios.js               # Build script for web assets
â””â”€â”€ dist/public/               # Web assets for iOS app
```

## Next Steps for App Store Deployment

### 1. Requirements

- **Mac with Xcode**: Required for iOS development
- **Apple Developer Account**: $99/year for App Store distribution
- **iOS Device**: For testing (iPhone/iPad)

### 2. Open in Xcode

```bash
npx cap open ios
```

This opens the iOS project in Xcode where you can:
- Configure app settings (bundle ID, version, etc.)
- Add app icons and launch screens
- Test on simulator or device
- Build for App Store submission

### 3. App Store Configuration

#### Update App Information:
- **Bundle ID**: Currently set to `com.myroommate.app`
- **App Name**: MyRoommate
- **Version**: Set your initial version (e.g., 1.0.0)

#### Add App Icons:
- Create icons in required sizes: 20x20, 29x29, 40x40, 58x58, 60x60, 76x76, 80x80, 87x87, 120x120, 152x152, 167x167, 180x180, 1024x1024
- Add to `ios/App/App/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/`

#### Configure Launch Screen:
- Customize `ios/App/App/Base.lproj/LaunchScreen.storyboard`
- Match your app's branding

### 4. App Store Connect Setup

1. Create app in App Store Connect
2. Set up app metadata (description, keywords, etc.)
3. Add screenshots (required sizes for iPhone/iPad)
4. Set pricing and availability

### 5. Build and Submit

```bash
# Sync latest changes
npx cap sync ios

# Open Xcode for final build
npx cap open ios
```

In Xcode:
1. Select "Any iOS Device" as target
2. Product â†’ Archive
3. Distribute App â†’ App Store Connect
4. Upload for review

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes to the Web App

1. Update your React web app
2. Run the build script: `node build-ios.js`
3. Sync with iOS: `npx cap sync ios`
4. Test in Xcode

### Testing

- **iOS Simulator**: Test basic functionality
- **Physical Device**: Test performance and native features
- **TestFlight**: Beta testing with real users

## Native Features Available

- **Status Bar**: Configured for light content
- **Splash Screen**: Custom branding with 2-second display
- **Haptic Feedback**: Touch feedback for better UX
- **Keyboard Management**: Automatic handling
- **App Lifecycle**: Proper background/foreground handling

## Production Considerations

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Bundle Size**: Optimize web assets for mobile
2. **Images**: Use WebP format where possible
3. **Caching**: Implement proper cache strategies
4. **Offline Support**: Consider service worker implementation

### Security

1. **HTTPS**: Ensure all API calls use HTTPS
2. **Data Protection**: Implement keychain storage for sensitive data
3. **Code Obfuscation**: Consider additional security measures

### App Store Guidelines Compliance

1. **Content Guidelines**: Ensure app content meets Apple's standards
2. **Technical Requirements**: Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines
3. **Privacy Policy**: Required for App Store submission
4. **Age Rating**: Set appropriate content rating

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Errors**: Ensure Xcode is updated to latest version
2. **Signing Issues**: Configure proper development/distribution certificates
3. **Plugin Conflicts**: Check Capacitor plugin compatibility
